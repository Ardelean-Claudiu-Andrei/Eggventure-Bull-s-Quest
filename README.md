# Eggventure-Bulls-Quest
This repository will contain the game that I realized during the internship.

## Technical Details
- The game is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- The game utilizes the HTML5 canvas element for rendering graphics.
- The Player, Obstacle, Egg, Larva, and Enemy classes handle different game elements, each with its own logic for drawing and updating.
- Collision detection is implemented using the `Math.hypot()` function to detect overlaps between game objects.
- The game objects are managed in arrays and are sorted by vertical position for correct rendering order.
- The game includes particle effects for visual feedback upon collisions and interactions.
- Debug mode can be toggled on and off by pressing the "d" key, providing additional information for testing.
- The game can be restarted by pressing the "r" key or clicking the "Restart" button.
